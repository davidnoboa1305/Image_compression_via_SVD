# Image_compression_via_SVD
Image compression using Singular Value Decomposition. This project's objective is to demonstrate how effectively can SVD-based compression reduce image storage requirements while maintaining acceptable visual quality.

## Why this project is different?
We try to give a deeper approach to this problem, image compression, by undenrstanding the very basics of what is behind. We design our own SVD algorithm following math thery and avoided using libraries that already offer something similar
